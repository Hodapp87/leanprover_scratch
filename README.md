After listening to the
excellent
[Functional Geekery #77](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-77-jared-roesch/) with
Jared Roesch, I took a look at [Lean][https://leanprover.github.io/].
This repository contains some of my scratch work in Lean as I read
tutorials and courses and work through the examples.

- [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/index.html)
  - Section 3, Propositions and Proofs: [tpl-sec3.lean](./tpl-sec3.lean)
  - Section 4, Quantifiers and Equality: [tpl-sec4.lean](./tpl-sec4.lean)
- *To do:* [Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/)
- *To do:* [Programming in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/programming_in_lean/)
- *To do:* [Theorem Proving in Lean (Lean2 version)](http://leanprover.github.io/tutorial/index.html)
  (maybe just the parts that aren't in the version at the top)
